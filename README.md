# **Deflationary Farming**

Farming tokens have a problem for their owners. To keep users farming, they have to mint more ever more coins. This completely destroys the value of the underlying token, due to excessive inflation. It's easy to find examples of this across the DeFi ecosystem.

Our solution is called deflationary farming, and it is quite simple in only two steps:

1. Charge a fee on token transfers
2. Users can earn the fee by farming

This simple process means that those holding tokens are able to farm without infinite inflation.
