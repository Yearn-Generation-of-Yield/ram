# RAM

RAM is a *non-inflationary* *cryptocurrency* designed for stable DeFi.

# **Deflationary Farming**

Farming tokens have a problem for their owners. To keep users farming, they have to mint more ever more coins. This completely destroys the value of the underlying token, due to excessive inflation. It's easy to find examples of this across the DeFi ecosystem.

Our solution is called deflationary farming, and it is quite simple in only two steps:

1. Charge a fee on token transfers
2. Users can earn the fee by farming

This simple process means that those holding tokens are able to farm without infinite inflation.

## Testing

To run the tests run
``` npx buidler test ```

## Kovan initial deployment

An initial version of the protocol has been deployed to the Kovan testnet. Do not use this version of the code on mainnet unless you want to lose your funds. The current contracts on Kovan are for testing.
